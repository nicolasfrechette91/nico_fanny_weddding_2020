    <div class="nicoAboutFanny" hidden>
      <p class="descriptionRight">Fanny is a really smart and ambitious person who always want to self improve.
        She loves to discover  <img class="imageDescriptionRight" src="../global/pictures/meetCouple/nico_fanny.jpg" alt="awesome couple"> and experiment with new hobbies as recently she's been putting a lot of time and effort into yoga, dancing (Tik Tok) and making her own videos.
        Fanny left her own country to come study, but primarily to explore the World as she loves traveling, discovering new cultures and seeing different ways of living.
        To top it all, Fanny not only loves discovering new foods, she also loves cooking and attempting any ideas that she saw on the Internet.
        Social by nature, she loves to keep contact with her close ones and will often try to meet or call her friends and family as she loves to get news from everyone.
        Lastly, Fanny's favorite activity is without a doubt sleeping. I'm pretty convinced that she loves it even more than me !

      <p class="descriptionLeft">Nico is a really generous and loving person. Always trying to make people laugh <img class="imageDescriptionLeft" src="../global/pictures/meetCouple/nico_nico.jpg" alt="awesome couple">
        even if it's at his own expense. He is a competitive person and he loves to participate in any kind of challenges. Nico is really into video games and always has been.
        Although he is comfortable being alone, he loves to be with Fanny and try new things or do the silliest games with her.
        Nico's a night owl and will always struggle to wake early but he will really often be the last one to go to bed.
        Nico dared to explore the rest of Canada and find new jobs opportunities in his second language in order to push himself.
        He's not afraid of making mistakes and see them more as learning experiences, he's able to recognize and accept his own errors.
